This results in solving the set of linear equation $$A*b = c$$ in which Matrix A is the transpose of eigen vector matrix and c is vector representing points in transformed coordinate system(p,q,r). To make the p-dimension larger we simply choose [1;0;0] as c. Now b is the point in the older coordinate system. Multiplying c with a positive value would give us more and more negative values of the constraint above. The value of the objective is also shown"
