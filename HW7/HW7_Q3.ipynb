    "# Homework 7 Question 3: ABC Investments.\n",
    "ABC Inc. is considering several investment options. Each option has\n",
    "a minimum investment required as well as a maximum investment allowed. These restrictions, along\n",
    "with the expected return are summarized in the following table (figures are in millions of dollars): \n",
    "\n",
    "Option | Minimum investment | Maximum investment | Expected return (%) |\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "1 | 3 | 27 | 13\n",
    "2 | 2 | 12 | 9\n",
    "3 | 9 | 35 | 17\n",
    "4 | 5 | 15 | 10\n",
    "5 | 12| 46 | 22\n",
    "6 | 4 | 18 | 12\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the high-risk nature of Option 5, company policy requires that the total amount invested\n",
    "in Option 5 be no more that the combined amount invested in Options 2, 4 and 6. In addition, if\n",
    "an investment is made in Option 3, it is required that at least a minimum investment be made in\n",
    "Option 6. ABC has $80 million to invest and obviously wants to maximize its total expected return\n",
    "on investment. Which options should ABC invest in, and how much should be invested?"
