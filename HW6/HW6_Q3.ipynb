    "# Homework 6 Question 3: Heat pipe design.\n",
    "A heated fluid at temperature $T$ (degrees above ambient temperature)\n",
    "flows in a pipe with fixed length and circular cross section with radius $r$. A layer of insulation, with\n",
    "thickness $w$, surrounds the pipe to reduce heat loss through the pipe walls ($w$ is much smaller than $r$).\n",
    "The design variables in this problem are $T, r$, and $w$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy cost due to heat loss is roughly equal to $α_1T r/w$. The cost of the pipe, which has a fixed\n",
    "wall thickness, is approximately proportional to the total material, i.e., it is given by $α_2r$. The cost of\n",
    "the insulation is also approximately proportional to the total insulation material, i.e., roughly $α_3rw$.\n",
    "The total cost is the sum of these three costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat flow down the pipe is entirely due to the flow of the fluid, which has a fixed velocity, i.e., it\n",
    "is given by $α_4T r^2$\n",
    ". The constants $α_i$ are all positive, as are the variables $T, r,$ and $w$.\n",
