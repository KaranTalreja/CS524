    "# Homework 8 Question 2: Paint production.\n",
    "As part of its weekly production, a paint company produces five batches\n",
    "of paints, always the same, for some big clients who have a stable demand. Every paint batch is\n",
    "produced in a single production process, all in the same blender that needs to be cleaned between each\n",
    "batch. The durations of blending paint batches 1 to 5 are 40, 35, 45, 32 and 50 minutes respectively.\n",
    "The cleaning times depend of the colors and the paint types. For example, a long cleaning period is\n",
    "required if an oil-based paint is produced after a water-based paint, or to produce white paint after a\n",
    "dark color. The times are given in minutes in the following matrix $A$ where $A_{ij}$ denotes the cleaning\n",
    "time after batch $i$ if it is followed by batch $j$. \n",
