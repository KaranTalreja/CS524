    "# Homework 3-Question 1:  Doodle scheduling\n",
    "Doodle Inc. is looking to interview a candidate for a new software\n",
    "engineer position at their company. It works like this: the interview (10 AM to 3 PM) is divided into\n",
    "a number of 20-minute time slots that may be used for 1-on-1 meetings with the candidate. There is\n",
    "also a one-hour time slot in the middle of the day where 3 employees take the candidate out for lunch.\n",
    "It would be nice for all 15 senior employees to meet with the candidate at some point during the\n",
    "day, but everybody has a busy schedule so itâ€™s not clear whether this will be possible. A doodle poll\n",
    "(obviously) was sent to the 15 senior employees to figure out their availability\n",
